## CostCow Defense

You start -Outside- of a CostCo (CostCow), defending it from people who are trying to hoard Lysol and toilet paper and what
not

Essentially a top-down zombie defense but to uphold social distancing and quarantine instead of murdering hapless fools

Buy new non-lethal weaponry, fend off increasing hordes of people.

## For the future:

Laserfiend: wave-survival game based on Costcow Defense
